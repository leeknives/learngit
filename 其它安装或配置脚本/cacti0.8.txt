1. yum  -y install httpd php  php*   mysql mysql-server net-snmp rrd-tool 
 
2. Configure PHP

Please ensure, that PHP support is either builtin or installed for the following PHP extension modules:

    mysql (For configuration, see note below)

    SNMP (For configuration, see note below)

    XML

    Session

    Sockets

    LDAP (Required only when using LDAP authentication)

    GD (Required only for some Plugins) 

You may run the following command to get the list of all available PHP modules

php -m

Please verify, that the modules are installed and configured correctly. There are several ways to do so, please consult PHP configuration instructions for a complete description.

We will continue using the most recommended way of configuring php extension modules. Please find the file /etc/php.ini and make the following changes to it:

extension_dir = /etc/php.d   /usr/lib64/php/modules/
 
This will enable PHP to find more configuration directives in that very directory. Other distros point to /usr/lib/php/modules instead. In each case, you should locate e.g. mysql.so in that directory.

Activate the MySQL extension via /etc/php.d/mysql.ini

; Enable mysql extension module
extension=mysql.so

Activate the SNMP extension via /etc/php.d/snmp.ini

; Enable snmp extension module
extension=snmp.so

If using PHP 4.3.5 or less include the following line. If using 4.3.6 or greater, you should remove this line if present.

session.save_path=/tmp

If you want to allow template importing, uncomment the following line:

file_uploads = On
3 	If you are using Apache 1.3.x, installation of PHP 5 is not recommended.

Please find the file /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf or equivalent and make the following changes to it:

# Load config files from the config directory "/etc/httpd/conf.d".
Include conf.d/*.conf

Now, please locate the PHP configuration file at /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf

If using PHP 5, then add the following lines.

# PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language which attempts to make it
# easy for developers to write dynamically generated webpages.
LoadModule php5_module modules/libphp5.so
#
# Cause the PHP interpreter to handle files with a .php extension.
AddHandler php5-script .php
AddType text/html .php
#
# Add index.php to the list of files that will be served as directory
# indexes.
DirectoryIndex index.php
4 set a password for the root user

shell> mysqladmin --user=root password somepassword
shell> mysqladmin --user=root --password reload

5 Install and Configure Cacti
     Extract the distribution tarball.

    shell> tar xzvf cacti-version.tar.gz

    Create the MySQL database:

    shell> mysqladmin --user=root create cacti

    Import the default cacti database:

    shell> mysql cacti < cacti.sql

    Optional: Create a MySQL username and password for Cacti.

    shell> mysql --user=root mysql
    mysql> GRANT ALL ON cacti.* TO root@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'centos';
    mysql> flush privileges;

    Edit include/config.php and specify the database type, name, host, user and password for your Cacti configuration.

    $database_type = "mysql";
    $database_default = "cacti";
    $database_hostname = "localhost";
    $database_username = "cactiuser";
    $database_password = "cacti";

    Set the appropriate permissions on cacti's directories for graph/log generation. You should execute these commands from inside cacti's directory to change the      permissions.
  
    shell> chown -R cactiuser rra/ log/

    (Enter a valid username for cactiuser, this user will also be used in the next step for data gathering.)

    Add a line to your /etc/crontab file similar to:

    */5 * * * * root  php /var/www/html/cacti/poller.php > /dev/null 2>&1

    Replace cactiuser with the valid user specified in the previous step.

    Replace /var/www/html/cacti/ with your full Cacti path.

    Point your web browser to:

        http://your-server/cacti/ 

    Log in the with a username/password of admin. You will be required to change this password immediately. Make sure to fill in all of the path variables carefully and correctly on the following screen.
